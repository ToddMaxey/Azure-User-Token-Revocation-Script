### 1. **High-Level Overview of the Script**

This PowerShell script is designed to revoke user sign-in sessions from Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) using Microsoft Graph API. It ensures that the required modules are installed, establishes a connection to Microsoft Graph, and iteratively processes user input to revoke sign-in sessions for multiple users. The script runs with elevated privileges, checks and installs necessary modules, and performs a pre- and post-revocation check on user sign-in activities. It provides logging information throughout the execution process and prompts the user if they want to process additional users.

### 2. **Detailed Overview of the Script**

#### **Elevated Privileges Check**
- **Function: `Test-IsAdmin`**
  - This function checks if the script is being run with administrator privileges by checking the role of the current Windows user.
  - If the current user is not an administrator, the script exits, prompting the user to rerun the script with elevated privileges.

#### **Module Management**
- **Function: `Ensure-Module`**
  - The function `Ensure-Module` accepts a module name as input and checks whether the module is installed on the system.
  - If the module is not installed, it installs it using `Install-Module` with `-Force` and `-AllowClobber` to avoid installation conflicts.

#### **Execution Policy and Modules Setup**
- **Set Execution Policy:**
  - The script temporarily sets the execution policy to `RemoteSigned` for the process, ensuring that the script can run without being blocked due to security restrictions.
  
- **Required Modules:**
  - The script checks for and installs three necessary modules:
    - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
    - `Microsoft.Graph.Users.Actions`
    - `Microsoft.Graph.Reports`

#### **Connection to Microsoft Graph**
- The script connects to Microsoft Graph with specific scopes:
  - `User.RevokeSessions.All`: To revoke sign-in sessions for users.
  - `AuditLog.Read.All`: To access audit logs.
  - `Directory.Read.All`: To read user directory information.

#### **Main Processing Loop**
- **User Input:**
  - The script prompts the user for a User Principal Name (UPN) or ObjectID to identify the user whose sessions are to be revoked.
  
- **Pre-revocation Check:**
  - The script queries the user's last sign-in activity before revocation using `Get-MgAuditLogSignIn`. It fetches details such as the sign-in timestamp, status, IP address, and application details.
  - This information is displayed in a formatted table.

- **Revoking Sessions:**
  - The script revokes the user's sign-in sessions with verbose and debug logging enabled using `Revoke-MgUserSignInSession`.

- **Post-revocation Check:**
  - After a 15-second delay (using `Start-Sleep`), the script again queries the user's sign-in activity to check if new sessions have been initiated after the revocation.
  
- **Comparison:**
  - The script compares the sign-in activity before and after revocation. If the sign-in timestamp hasn't changed, it logs a warning indicating that no new sign-in was detected and recommends checking Azure AD audit logs.
  
- **Azure AD Audit Logs:**
  - The script queries Azure AD audit logs using `Get-MgAuditLogDirectoryAudit` to check for session revocation events related to the user.

#### **Handling Multiple Users**
- After processing a user, the script prompts the administrator to confirm if there are more users to process.
  - If the response is "yes", it clears relevant variables and reinitiates the loop for the next user.
  - If the response is "no", the script terminates and prints a completion message.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Logging and Feedback:**
  - The script provides verbose output during the revocation process, such as when modules are installed or sessions are revoked.
  - It also gives feedback regarding the success or failure of session revocation.
  
- **Non-Interactive Debug Mode:**
  - `$DebugPreference = 'Continue'` ensures that debug messages are automatically displayed without requiring user interaction.

#### **Security and Error Handling:**
- The script handles scenarios where the user does not have elevated privileges by exiting early if necessary.
- It ensures necessary modules are available before performing operations, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- The comparison logic for session revocation offers a basic check to ensure that the action has taken effect.

#### **Potential Enhancements:**
- The script could be expanded to handle error conditions during the installation of modules or connection to Microsoft Graph.
- Adding more detailed logging (e.g., to a file) would improve auditing of the script's actions, especially for long-running scripts involving many users.
